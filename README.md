## Entry Level

We all gotta start somewhere. Most sushi here is not really considered omakase, and just variations of nigiri and handrolls. It doesn't mean it's not good! And they are way more wallet friendly.

* Sugarfish: I know people have bad things to say about this place, but for the price, no tip as well, and the quantity of food. This place is unbeatable. Yea maybe your sushi is about to fall apart and maybe it's not the highest quality fish (it's still pretty decent), but the principles are all there. I spend $80 here and am stuffed after.
* Nami Nori: Handrolls, with an extra flair.

## "Real" Omakase

In this category 

* Tanoshi: Very authentic omakase, also BYOB
* Thirteen Water: Chinese run but very well done

## Very good

* Sushi Amane: For the price, $250, this is my favorite omakase. Everything is very well done, more acidic rice. Chef Hayashi who used to be here sadly left end of 2024, but his uni rice was amazing. 

## Top

* Ginza Onodera: Really sad this place closed in NYC, it was also the best lunch time deal when it existed. 
* Icca: Great hospitality, beautiful glassware, great food, big 
* Shion 69
* Sushi Sho: best of the best, will also run your wallet down
