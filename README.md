# sushi

From my personal experiences. There are more comprehensive lists online, but I'm not a full-time sushi reviewer (I would like to eat more if I could), and my wallet is not that deep. But sushi is something I use to motivate myself.

Mostly NYC but as I become more Mr. Worldwide I will add more recs here. 

I will also say, at some point this list will just be consensus. But I've also had bad experiences at some restaurants which were supposed to be very good. Those are omitted on purpose here and to spare negative energy spreading I will not say bad things about them.

## The Idea

As with anything, you can't just jump to the best of the best and expect ot understand everything. Yes there are diminishing returns and all, but even from personal experience, e.g. drinking $700 wine at the start of my wine journey, there are just so many details you miss, and it's better money and time spent starting from the beginning. Obviously you can still enjoy nice sushi without "understanding" it. It's just food after all. But I think it would be good to have some sort of progression to avoid getting jaded or missing out on the beautiful world of sushi.

## Entry Level

We all gotta start somewhere. Most sushi here is not really considered omakase, and just variations of nigiri and handrolls. It doesn't mean it's not good! And they are way more wallet friendly.

* Sugarfish: I know people have bad things to say about this place, but for the price, no tip as well, and the quantity of food. This place is unbeatable. Yea maybe your sushi is about to fall apart and maybe it's not the highest quality fish (it's still pretty decent), but the principles are all there. I spend $80 here and am stuffed after.
* Nami Nori: Handrolls, with an extra flair.

## "Real" Omakase

In this category we start seeing the hot-spot of omakases, of meals you can get in the $100 ish range. There is also a lot of very mediocre joints in this range as well, as people have been trying to replicate the high-ish margins of a simple ingredient prep business. But I try to avoid "too good to be true" omakase prices like $60 because usually you are rushed, you get inexperienced chefs, etc.

* Tanoshi: Very authentic omakase, also BYOB
* Thirteen Water: Chinese run but very well done

## Very good

* Sushi Amane: For the price, $250, this is my favorite omakase. Everything is very well done, more acidic rice. Chef Hayashi who used to be here sadly left end of 2024, but his uni rice was amazing.
* Sushi Zo: Sadly closed in NYC now, but they have other locations. This is where I had nodoguro for the first time and I loved it ever since. The chefs also constantly ice their hands to not warm the sushi while making it. And the chefs are super friendly.

## Top

* Yoshizumi: Undisputed the best sushi in the Bay Area, but also world class on its own. Super traditional, a LOT of food, and everything is very well-done.
* Ginza Onodera: Really sad this place closed in NYC (they also have LA and Hawaii and in Ginza ofc), it was also the best lunch time deal when it existed. A lot of great chefs start their own sushiya after working at Ginza.
* Icca: Great hospitality, beautiful glassware, great food, big portions.
* Shion 69
* Sushi Sho: best of the best, will also run your wallet down
